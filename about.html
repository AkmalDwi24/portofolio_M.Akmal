                <h2>About Me </h2>
                <p> I'm a passionate <strong>Frontend and Game Developer</strong> with a deep enthusiasm for crafting engaging, interactive, and visually compelling digital experiences. My journey in development began with a curiosity about how design and code can work together to create not just interfaces—but experiences that resonate.</p>
                <p> Over the years, I've honed my skills in <strong>responsive web design</strong>, <strong>UI/UX animations</strong>, and <strong>gameplay programming</strong>, building everything from clean, accessible websites to interactive game mechanics that bring ideas to life. I strive to merge aesthetics with functionality, ensuring every project is both intuitive and immersive.</p>
                <p>I believe that great development is about more than just code—it's about telling stories, solving problems, and building meaningful interactions that connect with people emotionally. Whether it's a seamless user interface or a fun game mechanic, I aim to create moments that inspire and leave a lasting impression.</p>
